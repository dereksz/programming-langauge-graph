# programming-langauge-graph

My copy / version of this well distributed `dot` file that shows the relationship between programming langauges

## Credits

Originally from http://rigaux.org/language-study/language-study.list
Built into `dot` file (http://rigaux.org/language-study/diagram.dot) 
per http://rigaux.org/language-study/diagram.html
And I suspect this goes back even further to the GraphViz sample version

## Intention

My intention was two-fold:
1. add some more langauges;
1. have it orderred in a way that made it more human accessible / searchable.

To that end, I intend the file to be in three sections:
1. Year the langauge or valguage-version was introduced, no links / lineage
2. Single-langauge lineage; e.g. how Python or Fortran versions should be linked
3. "Genesis" sets (yes, I was listening to Genesis when I wrote this!)
   These list the influences for the initial release of a language.
4. I said 3 didn't I!!!  Well, may need something that isn't neatly covered by the above
   E.g. when a language significantly influences features brough into a new version of a language
   There's also stuff in this section that I've yet to migrate to #2 & #3
